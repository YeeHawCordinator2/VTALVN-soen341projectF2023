Everyone was here for all the team meetings.
We updated the team on what we have done while we did not talk with each other and we said what left we have to complete.
The team meeting was approximately 15 minutes long and everyone had the chance to talk and give their opinion on the tasks
we have left.
We ended the call by giving a day where we will meet again.
