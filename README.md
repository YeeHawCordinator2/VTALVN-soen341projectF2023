As a team we decided it was best to use javascript as a backend and frontend language to reduce the learning of new material all the member would have to do. This would save time and ressources.

The most popular backend framework for javascript is express.js which works with node.js. Other popular frameworks we looked at were django for python and lavarel for php. The reason express was chosen is mainly because we decided to chose javascript as backend language, and most member did not know php or python. We also found javascript to be the easiest to learn with express being on of the most easy frameworks. Django is also a very good framework but it required a strong foundation of Python which 1 member had on top of being much better for big project instead of small projects. Lavarel is also not very hard but demands lots of MVC framework knowledge which we did not have on the team. Looking at those three options we chose express which is easy and intuitve. Express is also known to be good for beginners, scalable and efficient. 

Express: pros: simple, flexible, scalable, cross-platform, lightweight, template engine, database support, for javascript <br>
cons: frequent updates, lack of structure, liited built-in features <br>
Django: pros:fast processing, rapid-developpement, scalable, lots of functionality, secure <br>
cons: for python, monolithic, not good for small project <br>
lavarel: pros: secure, simple, robust deployement, good integration, template engine <br>
cons:for php, not flexile, not best efficiency for performance, confusing, steep learning curve, frequent updates <br>

Overall, express is the easiest, template base and is for javascript. Learning python or php on top of already learning javascript for frontend is a waste of time and is not worth it since express is very good. 

For front end frameworks, we were stuck between bootstrap, angular and react. Angular and React are very good frontend frameworks except that we are complete beginner at all three framework. Bootstrap is the easiest out of the three and gives us ready made templates to use to make our work easier instead of react which is component base meaning we would have to work harder to achieve the same result as bootstrap. React and angular are much harder to use simpy because it is not template based. Since the project is not very long we decided that taking the easier route would probably be better for us. We are limiting ourself in term of creativity and what we can do since we are chosing a set template but it will save us lots of time. 

react: pros: easy to learn, good for dynamic web apps, reusable components, high perfomance, component base <br>
cons:high pace development, poor documentation, not full feature, lack of conventions, not full-feature, learning curve <br>
angular: pros: component based, reusability, readability, maintainability, MVC architecture <br>
cons:complex, hard learning curve, bad documentation <br>
bootstrap: pros: responsive, simple, superior components, user-made template, lots of features, fast, avoid cross browser bug, consistent <br>
cons: learning curve, limited customization freedom, need lot of style overrides  <br>

Overall, bootstrap is more simple and easier to learn and use, it also bring consistency and templates with a lot of features. We will not chose angular because it is a lot more difficult and react demand a bigger javascript knowledge. React is also very good but using templates will be easier than creating and using components.
