We met for about 45 minutes (6:45-7:30)
We first presented ourself and what program we were in
we then talked about programming languages we were good and confortable with along 
with which programming classes we took in the past.
We then decided that Javascript was the smartest language to use for our project because it is 
a front end langage but also because it can be used as a backend language with the use of some frameworks
We then decided who will be frontend (amine and alessandro), backend (nao, nooralmustafa amd darren) and fullstack (Richard)
Nao had already created the repositery so we then gave out our fullname, id and github username so we could all be added in the repositery.
