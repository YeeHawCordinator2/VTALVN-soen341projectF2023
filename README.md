### Objective
***
Learn how to work in teams to develop a software project. <br>
### Project
***
Part of this class is to learn different software management methodologies for programming. This project allows us to test one of them; the Agile Methodology.
We have to manage ourselves, separate the work, and work together to create a functional product.
We also learn how to work with a user, their demands and expectsations.<br>

This project will be a real estate web application with many different features for the homebuyers, property renters, brokers and System administrators. While given a set number of features, we are also expected to think out of the box and add feature that could be useful after talking with our user.

### Technologies
***
Javascript<br>
Node.js<br>
Express.js<br>
Bootstrap<br>


As a team we decided it was best to use javascript as a backend and frontend language to reduce the learning of new material all the member would have to do. This would save time and ressources.

The most popular backend framework for javascript is express.js which works with node.js. Other popular frameworks we looked at were django for python and lavarel for php. The reason express was chosen is mainly because we decided to chose javascript as backend language, and most member did not know php or python. We also found javascript to be the easiest to learn with express being on of the most easy frameworks. Django is also a very good framework but it required a strong foundation of Python which 1 member had. Lavarel is also not very hard but demands lots of MVC framework knowledge which we did not have on the team. Looking at those three options we chose express which is easy and intuitve. Express is also known to be good for beginners, scalable and efficient. 

For front end frameworks, we were stuck between bootstrap, angular and react. Angular and React are very good frontend frameworks except that we are complete beginner at all three framework. Bootstrap is the easiest out of the three and gives us ready made templates to use to make our work easier instead of react which is component base meaning we would have to work harder to achieve the same result as bootstrap. React and angular are much harder to use simpy because it is not template based. Since the project is not very long we decided that taking the easier route would probably be better for us. We are limiting ourself in term of creativity and what we can do since we are chosing a set template but it will save us lots of time.
