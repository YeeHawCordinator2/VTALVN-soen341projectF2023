Learn how to work in teams to develop a software project. <br>
### Project
***
Part of this class is to learn different software management methodologies for programming. This project allows us to test one of them; the Agile Methodology.
We have to manage ourselves, separate the work, and work together to create a functional product.
We also learn how to work with a user, their demands and expectsations.<br>

This project will be a real estate web application with many different features for the homebuyers, property renters, brokers and System administrators. While given a set number of features, we are also expected to think out of the box and add feature that could be useful after talking with our user.
