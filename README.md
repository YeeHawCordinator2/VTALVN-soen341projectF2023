<h3> Description </h3> 
<p align="justify"> The team must create a Real Estate Web Application to allow the client to buy, sell, and rent properties. The website will offer a platform where the user will be able to narrow down the available properties based on their preferences and needs.
<br><br> Our platform should offer a user-friendly experience in which the visual interface of the program should be simple while highlighting the key features and functionalities implemented for the client. 
</p>
<h3>Key features of our application</h3>


1. <h4> Filtering System </h4>
   <p align="justify"> 
   The client will be able to find their ideal property by using our filtering system which allows the client to narrow down the available properties based on their preferences and needs. Such search functionalities include the property's location, the number of bedrooms, the price range, and much more. 
   </p>

2. <h4> Property Visits </h4>
   <p align="justify">
   A calendar will be implemented to allow the client to book an appointment based on their availabilities to visit their property of interest.
   <br>The application should keep track of the booked appointments, in other words, reduce the available time slots based on the currently set appointments.
   <!-- //The user should be able to cancel their appointment. -->  
   </p>

3. <h4> Visual description of the property </h4>
   <p align="justify"> Under each property, there will be many clear images of each room and aspect of the listed building. A detailed description with everything the client needs to know will have to be provided by the owner in order to give a transparent experience to the users.
   </p>

4. <h4> Choosing a broker </h4>
   <p align="justify"> Clients will be able to choose the broker they wish. They will be provided with details about the broker and the number of properties he helped the clients to sell or loan their property so that the clients can make their judgment on who to choose as a broker. Furthermore, the contact information of the broker will be provided so that the interested clients can directly contact them.
   </p>

5. <h4> Mortgage calculator </h4> 
   <p align="justify"> Our web application will have a calculator that will help the clients to estimate their monthly payments based on the loan they will take and the interest rate that comes with it.
   </p>

6.  <h4>Favorite Properties </h4>
   <p align="justify"> Clients will be able to favourite the properties they are interested in. This feature will allow them to keep looking for other properties while not losing the other ones that they liked. After a long research, they will be able to compare and choose the one property they liked the most.

As a team we decided it was best to use javascript as a backend and frontend language to reduce the learning of new material all the member would have to do. This would save time and ressources.

The most popular backend framework for javascript is express.js which works with node.js. Other popular frameworks we looked at were django for python and lavarel for php. The reason express was chosen is mainly because we decided to chose javascript as backend language, and most member did not know php or python. We also found javascript to be the easiest to learn with express being on of the most easy frameworks. Django is also a very good framework but it required a strong foundation of Python which 1 member had on top of being much better for big project instead of small projects. Lavarel is also not very hard but demands lots of MVC framework knowledge which we did not have on the team. Looking at those three options we chose express which is easy and intuitve. Express is also known to be good for beginners, scalable and efficient. 

Express: pros: simple, flexible, scalable, cross-platform, lightweight, template engine, database support, for javascript <br>
cons: frequent updates, lack of structure, liited built-in features <br>
Django: pros:fast processing, rapid-developpement, scalable, lots of functionality, secure <br>
cons: for python, monolithic, not good for small project <br>
lavarel: pros: secure, simple, robust deployement, good integration, template engine <br>
cons:for php, not flexile, not best efficiency for performance, confusing, steep learning curve, frequent updates <br>

Overall, express is the easiest, template base and is for javascript. Learning python or php on top of already learning javascript for frontend is a waste of time and is not worth it since express is very good. 

For front end frameworks, we were stuck between bootstrap, angular and react. Angular and React are very good frontend frameworks except that we are complete beginner at all three framework. Bootstrap is the easiest out of the three and gives us ready made templates to use to make our work easier instead of react which is component base meaning we would have to work harder to achieve the same result as bootstrap. React and angular are much harder to use simpy because it is not template based. Since the project is not very long we decided that taking the easier route would probably be better for us. We are limiting ourself in term of creativity and what we can do since we are chosing a set template but it will save us lots of time. 

react: pros: easy to learn, good for dynamic web apps, reusable components, high perfomance, component base <br>
cons:high pace development, poor documentation, not full feature, lack of conventions, not full-feature, learning curve <br>
angular: pros: component based, reusability, readability, maintainability, MVC architecture <br>
cons:complex, hard learning curve, bad documentation <br>
bootstrap: pros: responsive, simple, superior components, user-made template, lots of features, fast, avoid cross browser bug, consistent <br>
cons: learning curve, limited customization freedom, need lot of style overrides  <br>

Overall, bootstrap is more simple and easier to learn and use, it also bring consistency and templates with a lot of features. We will not chose angular because it is a lot more difficult and react demand a bigger javascript knowledge. React is also very good but using templates will be easier than creating and using components.
