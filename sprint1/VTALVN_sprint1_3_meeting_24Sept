This meeting took us 25 minutes. All the members were here.
Everyone took approximately 5 minutes to talk.
Each of us said what is there left to do in each of our tasks (took 10 minutes).
We were all almost done or done. There was no pressure since we worked on our task since the start of the sprint.
No one had to do tasks of other people in our team because we were all on time in our tasks and the tasks were well divided.
We then started to talk quickly again about sprint 2 just to prepare ourselves for the next sprint (5 minutes).
We then gave ourselves small tasks to do for the next meeting (5 minutes).
We ended the meeting by giving a time when we should meet again. We found a day when everyone was free (5minutes).
