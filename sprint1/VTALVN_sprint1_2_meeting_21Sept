Everyone was here for all the team meetings.
We updated the team on what we had done while we did not talk with each other and we said what we had to complete.
The team meeting was approximately 15 minutes long and everyone had the chance to speak and give their opinion on the tasks
we had left.
We ended the call by giving a day when we will meet again.
