The team held a meeting during the lab period for about 60 minutes (6:30-7:30).

We met up with the lab instructor and showed him the progress made throughout the week on the Sprint 1.
So far, we have worked on the README file containing the project description, the team members and roles,
the technologies used for this project, as well as an installation instruction section for the NodeJS framework.

The lab instructor reviewed our work and suggested some further guidelines/improvements to bring our Spring 1 documents.

We first presented ourself and what program we were in
we then talked about programming languages we were good and comfortable with along
with which programming classes we took in the past.
We then decided that Javascript was the smartest language to use for our project because it is
a front end langage but also because it can be used as a backend language with the use of some frameworks
We then decided who will be frontend (amine and alessandro), backend (nao, nooralmustafa amd darren) and fullstack (Richard)
Nao had already created the repositery so we then gave out our fullname, id and github username so we could all be added in the repositery.
