A clear objective and image of the first Sprint 1 should be conceived. We would like to publish a few issues, create labels, assign tasks, add elements to the repo 
according to the rubric.

-Meeting content

We first presented ourself and what program we were in (5 min)
we then talked about programming languages we were good and comfortable with along 
with which programming classes we took in the past.(5 min)
We then decided that Javascript was the smartest language to use for our project because it is 
a front end language but also because it can be used as a backend language with the use of some frameworks. (25 min) 
We then decided who will be frontend (amine and alessandro), backend (nao, nooralmustafa amd darren) and fullstack (Richard) (5 min)
Nao had already created the repository so we then gave out our full name, id and github username so we could all be added in the repository. (5 min)
