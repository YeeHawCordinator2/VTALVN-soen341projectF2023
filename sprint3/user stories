User Stories for on:
1. Mortgage Calculator (in the Homebuyer profile)
    Not much information available currently on the implementation of the Mortgage Calculator.
    There are many different Mortgage Calculator available online such as:
        - Mortgage Payment Calculator
        - Mortgage Affordability Calculator
        - Down Payment Calculator

    Here are some examples of some Mortgage Calculator from Banks:
        - RBC: https://apps.royalbank.com/apps/mortgages/mortgage-payment-calculator/
        - TD Bank: https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/products/mortgages/calculators-tools
        - Scotiabank: https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.html

    The following Real-Estate website has three different Mortgage Calculators implemented:
        From REALTOR.ca: https://www.realtor.ca/calculator#v=payment
        - Payment Calculator
        - Land Transfer Tax Calculator
        - Affordability Calculator

        (It would be easier for us to implement just one of the calculators - probably the Payment Calculator - but we
        could implement more than one if the team wants to.)

2. A new feature proposed by the team to make the web app more productive than the competence.
    This feature will be discussed and chosen among the team members.

    PS: It could be the implementation of an interactive Calendar as we've already planned,
        since this isn't an actual requirement given by the professor.
