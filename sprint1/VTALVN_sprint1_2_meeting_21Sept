******DETAILED VERSION******

The team held a meeting during the lab period for about 90 minutes (6:30-8:00 PM) on September 21st.

We met up with the lab instructor and showed him the progress made throughout the week on the Sprint 1.
So far, we have worked on the README file containing the project description, the team members and roles,
the technologies used for this project, as well as an installation instruction section for the Node.js framework.

The lab instructor reviewed our work and suggested some further guidelines/improvements to bring our Spring 1 documents.
    First, for the user stories, we will need to define the realistic priorities of each features as well as the
    acceptance criteria for the users (relevant to the CRUD operations).
    Second, for the GITHUB, it is recommended to add to the WIKI section any information containing details about the
    implementation and technologies used for this project. Furthermore, we will need to assign a role to each
    team members, and add further details (for example the member's strengths). Then, it is recommended to keep
    the README file concise.
    Third, he suggests that our team should hold frequent meetings throughout the week to observe the progress made,
    and checkup on the other team members.

Today, our team, with our lab instructor, have discussed how we should breakdown/divide our tasks to complete the
project and how we can resolve some issues on our GITHUB page such as the issue regarding branch protection.

Our team leader also took the time to explain GITHUB functionalities such as "PULL REQUESTS", "COMMIT", and "PUSH" to
the team members.

Finally, each team members worked together to revise the Sprint 1 release, and work on their own tasks.
