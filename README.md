## Project
***
<h3> Description </h3> 
<p align="justify"> The team must create a Real Estate Web Application to allow the client to buy, sell, and rent properties. The website will offer a platform where the user will be able to narrow down the available properties based on their preferences and needs.
<br><br> Our platform should offer a user-friendly experience in which the visual interface of the program should be simple while highlighting the key features and functionalities implemented for the client. 
</p>

<h3>Key Features of our application</h3>


   1. <h4> Filtering System </h4>
      <p align="justify"> 
      The client will be able to find their ideal property by using our filtering system which allows the client to narrow down the available properties based on their preferences and needs. Such search functionalities include the property's location, the number of bedrooms, the price range, and much more. 
      </p>

   2. <h4> Property Visits </h4>
      <p align="justify">
      A calendar will be implemented to allow the client to book an appointment based on their availabilities to visit their property of interest.
      <br>The application should keep track of the booked appointments, in other words, reduce the available time slots based on the currently set appointments.
      <!-- //The user should be able to cancel their appointment. -->  
      </p>

   3. <h4> Visual Description of the Property </h4>
      <p align="justify">
      Under each property listing, multiple images depicting the different rooms, common areas, and exterior of the property will be made available to the client with a detailed description of the house. 
      Such descriptions include the dimensions of the house, the amount of bedrooms and bathrooms, the presence of an attic or a basement, the year the house was built, any major renovations made to the house, etc.
      </p>

   4. <h4> Choosing a broker </h4>
      <p align="justify"> 
      A list of brokers will be made available to the client to choose from, containing the brokers' contact information, their contract history, and previous clients' reviews and ratings.
      </p>

   5. <h4> Mortgage Calculator </h4> 
      <p align="justify"> 
      A mortgage calculator will be implemented to allow the clients to estimate their monthly payments based on their loan with the appropriate interest rate.
      </p>

   6.  <h4>Additional Feature: Favorites </h4>
      <p align="justify"> 
      A "Favorite" feature will be implemented which allows the client to bookmark and save the listing of a certain property that they find interesting.
      Each "Favorite" property will be added to the "Favorite" list, where the client can easily access all of their saved properties.
      <br>
      This feature also includes a "Compare" functionality which allows the client to compare the different key features of two to three properties in a single page.
      </p>

## Technologies
***
<p align="justify">
The following list regroups the technologies that will be used to develop the Real Estate Web Application.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Javascript</li>
   <li>Node.js</li>
   <li>Express.js</li>
   <li>Bootstrap</li>
   <li>MongoDB</li>
</ul>

<h4> Why JavaScript? </h4>

<p align="justify">
      
As a team, we chose to develop the web application by using JavaScript for both the front-end and back-end since
all the team members have prior experience with programming using this language, which would save time and resources
by avoiding learning a new programming language. 
</p>
<h4>Supporting Technologies</h4>
<ul><li>Back-End</li></ul>
<p align="justify">
For this project, we chose to use the most popular back-end framework for JavaScript, Express.js, since it is also compatible with Node.js. 
<br><br>
We have taken in consideration other popular frameworks such as Django for Python and Lavarel for PHP,
but we ultimately decided to opt with Express.js and Node.js since our team members feel more confident programming with JavaScript compared with Python or PHP.


</p>
<br><br>

The most popular backend framework for javascript is express.js which works with node.js. Other popular frameworks we looked at were django for python and lavarel for php. The reason express was chosen is mainly because we decided to chose javascript as backend language, and most member did not know php or python. We also found javascript to be the easiest to learn with express being on of the most easy frameworks. Django is also a very good framework but it required a strong foundation of Python which 1 member had on top of being much better for big project instead of small projects. Lavarel is also not very hard but demands lots of MVC framework knowledge which we did not have on the team. Looking at those three options we chose express which is easy and intuitve. Express is also known to be good for beginners, scalable and efficient. 

<br><br>
Express: pros: simple, flexible, scalable, cross-platform, lightweight, template engine, database support, for javascript <br>
cons: frequent updates, lack of structure, limited built-in features <br>
Django: pros:fast processing, rapid-development, scalable, lots of functionality, secure <br>
cons: for python, monolithic, not good for small project <br>
lavarel: pros: secure, simple, robust deployment, good integration, template engine <br>
cons:for php, not flexible, not the best efficiency for performance, confusing, steep learning curve, frequent updates <br>

Overall, express is the easiest, template base and is for javascript. Learning python or php on top of already learning javascript for frontend is a waste of time and is not worth it since express is very good. 

For front end frameworks, we were stuck between bootstrap, angular and react. Angular and React are very good frontend frameworks except that we are complete beginner at all three framework. Bootstrap is the easiest out of the three and gives us ready made templates to use to make our work easier instead of react which is component base meaning we would have to work harder to achieve the same result as bootstrap. React and angular are much harder to use simpy because it is not template based. Since the project is not very long we decided that taking the easier route would probably be better for us. We are limiting ourself in term of creativity and what we can do since we are chosing a set template but it will save us lots of time. 

react: pros: easy to learn, good for dynamic web apps, reusable components, high perfomance, component base <br>
cons:high pace development, poor documentation, not full feature, lack of conventions, not full-feature, learning curve <br>
angular: pros: component based, reusability, readability, maintainability, MVC architecture <br>
cons:complex, hard learning curve, bad documentation <br>
bootstrap: pros: responsive, simple, superior components, user-made template, lots of features, fast, avoid cross browser bug, consistent <br>
cons: learning curve, limited customization freedom, need lot of style overrides  <br>

Overall, bootstrap is more simple and easier to learn and use, it also bring consistency and templates with a lot of features. We will not chose angular because it is a lot more difficult and react demand a bigger javascript knowledge. React is also very good but using templates will be easier than creating and using components.
